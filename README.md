# Banking-managment-system

This Banking Management System project was created to automate banking operations, enhancing the efficiency of account management, transactions, and loan processing. By implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, such as classes and functions, the system ensures better code organization and maintainability. The init() function is used for initializing account data, while the system supports features like credit and debit transactions, making it easier for customers and bank employees to manage finances securely. This project demonstrates the practical application of OOP in real-world banking solutions.
